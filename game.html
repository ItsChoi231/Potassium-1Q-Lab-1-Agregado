            <br>
            Flappy Bird is a simple yet challenging mobile game where the player controls a bird navigating through a series of green pipes. 
            The goal is to fly as far as possible without hitting any pipes, with each successful passage awarding a point. 
            The game's difficulty stems from the bird's constant descent, 
            requiring precise taps on the screen to make it flap its wings and ascend.
